# Medical Image Preprocessing Pipeline for DICOM Files

## Problem Understanding

Medical imaging quality significantly impacts the accuracy of downstream AI models used for diagnostic tasks such as caries detection, bone loss assessment, and other clinical applications. Raw DICOM images often suffer from various quality issues including:

- **Poor contrast** due to imaging conditions or patient positioning
- **Noise artifacts** from equipment limitations or electromagnetic interference  
- **Inconsistent brightness** across different scanners and protocols
- **Blurriness** from patient movement or focus issues

This project addresses these challenges by developing an **adaptive preprocessing pipeline** that intelligently adjusts enhancement parameters based on individual image characteristics, moving beyond one-size-fits-all static approaches.

### Significance
- Improved image quality leads to better feature extraction for AI models
- Adaptive processing reduces the need for manual parameter tuning
- Standardized preprocessing enables consistent model performance across different imaging equipment
- Enhanced diagnostic accuracy through optimized image quality

## Dataset Description

The project processes DICOM medical images with the following handling approach:

### Data Loading Strategy
- **Robust DICOM parsing** using `pydicom` with error handling for corrupted files
- **Multi-format support** for various DICOM file extensions (.dcm, .DCM, .dicom, .DICOM)
- **Metadata extraction** including modality, pixel spacing, photometric interpretation
- **Automatic normalization** to standardized 0-255 pixel intensity range

### Data Characteristics Handled
- Different bit depths (8-bit, 16-bit)
- Various modalities (X-ray, CT, MRI, etc.)
- Multiple photometric interpretations (MONOCHROME1, MONOCHROME2)
- Rescale slope/intercept transformations
- Missing or corrupted metadata tags

## Methodology

### Image Quality Metrics

#### 1. Brightness Assessment
```python
def compute_brightness(img: np.ndarray) -> float:
    return float(np.mean(img))
```
- Measures overall image luminance
- Used to detect under/over-exposed images

#### 2. Contrast Evaluation
- **Standard Deviation Contrast**: `σ = √(E[(I - μ)²])`
- **RMS Contrast**: `√(mean((I - μ)²))`
- Quantifies intensity variation and dynamic range

#### 3. Sharpness Metrics
- **Laplacian Variance**: Measures edge definition using second derivative
- **Tenengrad**: Sobel-based gradient magnitude for focus assessment
```python
def compute_tenengrad(img: np.ndarray) -> float:
    gx = cv2.Sobel(img, cv2.CV_64F, 1, 0, ksize=3)
    gy = cv2.Sobel(img, cv2.CV_64F, 0, 1, ksize=3)
    return float(np.sqrt(gx**2 + gy**2).mean())
```

#### 4. Noise Estimation
- **Local Standard Deviation**: Analyzes variance in flat image regions
- **Percentile-based**: Uses 10th percentile of patch standard deviations
- Identifies homogeneous regions for noise characterization

### Static Preprocessing Baseline

The static pipeline applies fixed parameters regardless of image content:

```python
def static_preprocessing(img: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # 1. Histogram Equalization
    eq = cv2.equalizeHist(img)
    
    # 2. Fixed Sharpening Kernel
    sharpen_kernel = np.array([[0, -1,  0], [-1, 5, -1], [0, -1,  0]])
    sharp = cv2.filter2D(eq, -1, sharpen_kernel)
    
    # 3. Gaussian Denoising
    denoised = cv2.GaussianBlur(sharp, (3, 3), sigmaX=0.5)
    return denoised
```

**Limitations:**
- No consideration of individual image characteristics
- May over-enhance good quality images
- Insufficient processing for severely degraded images

### Adaptive Preprocessing Pipeline

#### Algorithm Overview
The adaptive pipeline dynamically adjusts parameters based on computed quality metrics:

#### 1. Adaptive Contrast Enhancement (CLAHE)
```python
# Parameter selection based on contrast metric
if contrast < 30:
    clip_limit = 4.0    # Strong enhancement
elif contrast < 60:
    clip_limit = 2.0    # Medium enhancement  
else:
    clip_limit = 1.0    # Mild enhancement
```

#### 2. Adaptive Sharpening (Unsharp Masking)
```python
# Sharpening strength based on edge content
if sharpness < 100:
    amount = 1.5  # Strong sharpening for blurry images
elif sharpness < 300:
    amount = 1.0  # Medium sharpening
else:
    amount = 0.5  # Mild sharpening for sharp images
```

#### 3. Adaptive Denoising (Bilateral Filtering)
```python
# Denoising parameters based on noise estimate
if noise > 10:
    d, sigma_color, sigma_space = 9, 75, 75  # Strong denoising
elif noise > 5:
    d, sigma_color, sigma_space = 7, 50, 50  # Medium denoising
else:
    d, sigma_color, sigma_space = 5, 25, 25  # Mild denoising
```

#### Key Innovations
- **Metric-driven parameter selection**: Preprocessing intensity adapts to image quality
- **Multi-stage processing**: Sequential application of complementary techniques
- **Quality-aware thresholds**: Empirically determined decision boundaries
- **Preservation of diagnostic features**: Avoids over-processing that could remove important details

### ML/DL Approach (Proof of Concept)

#### U-Net Architecture for Denoising
- **Encoder-Decoder structure** with skip connections
- **Input**: Noisy medical images (256×256×1)
- **Output**: Denoised images with preserved anatomical structures

```python
def build_unet(input_shape):
    # Contracting path
    c1 = Conv2D(32, 3, activation='relu', padding='same')(inputs)
    p1 = MaxPooling2D()(c1)
    
    # Expanding path  
    u1 = UpSampling2D()(c3)
    u1 = concatenate([u1, c2])  # Skip connection
    
    outputs = Conv2D(1, 1, activation='sigmoid')(c5)
    return Model(inputs, outputs)
```

#### Training Strategy
- **Synthetic noise addition** to create training pairs
- **MSE loss function** for pixel-wise reconstruction
- **Data augmentation** through rotation and scaling
- **Validation split** for generalization assessment
